# GET /api/effects

The **`/api/effects`** route provides access to the granular state changes that occur on the Stellar network. While an operation describes a high-level action (e.g., "Payment"), effects describe every side effect of that action (e.g., "Account Credited" and "Account Debited").

## Overview

Effects are the smallest data primitive on Stellar for tracking state. They are essential for building activity feeds, audit logs, and transaction histories that accurately reflect changes to account balances, trustlines, and permissions.

### Operations vs. Effects

A single operation can result in multiple effects. For example, a `Payment` operation usually produces:
1.  **account_debited**: For the sender.
2.  **account_credited**: For the receiver.

> **Relationship Diagram:**
> `Transaction` → `Operation` → `[Effect 1, Effect 2, ...]`

## Code Example: Activity Timeline

This example demonstrates how to fetch effects and format them into a human-readable activity feed.

```typescript
const fetchActivity = async (publicKey: string) => {
  const url = `/api/effects?account=${publicKey}&limit=20&order=desc`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();

  return data.map((effect: any) => {
    switch (effect.type_i) {
      case 70: // account_credited
        return `Received ${effect.amount} ${effect.asset_code || 'XLM'}`;
      case 71: // account_debited
        return `Sent ${effect.amount} ${effect.asset_code || 'XLM'}`;
      case 20: // trustline_created
        return `Opened trustline for ${effect.asset_code}`;
      case 33: // trade
        return `Traded ${effect.sold_amount} ${effect.sold_asset_code} for ${effect.bought_amount} ${effect.bought_asset_code}`;
      default:
        return `Network Event: ${effect.type.replace('_', ' ')}`;
    }
  });
};
```
