# Nextellar CLI — Scaffolding Templates

Nextellar’s CLI includes support for selecting templates using the `--example` flag, but **no official templates have been released yet**.

This page serves as a placeholder and future reference for when templates become available.

---

## Current Status

* The `--example` / `-e` flag is implemented in the CLI.
* **However, no example names are currently shipped**, and attempting to pass a template name will result in an error.
* The default scaffold is the only available output at this time.

---

## Using the Template Flag (When Templates Become Available)

The syntax for selecting a template will be:

```bash
npx nextellar my-app --example <template-name>
```

Example (future):

```bash
npx nextellar my-app --example payments-demo
```

Until templates are released, this command will not function.

---

## Planned Template Categories

The following template categories are planned for future releases:

### **1. Payments Demo**

A starter showing:

* Stellar wallet connection
* Balance viewer
* Sending payments

### **2. Soroban Contract Demo**

A scaffold for:

* Reading contract data
* Writing contract data
* Interacting with Soroban RPC

### **3. Minimal Starter**

A lightweight version of the default scaffold with fewer UI layers.

These are **not yet available**. Documentation will be expanded once templates are officially released.

---

## Template Comparison (Future)

Once templates launch, they will be compared across:

* Wallet support
* Payment flows
* Contract interaction
* UI complexity
* Recommended use cases

This table will be added once specifications are finalized.

---

## Roadmap: Custom Templates

A future Nextellar release will introduce support for **user-defined custom templates**, enabling teams to build internal presets.

Planned command:

```bash
nextellar generate template <name>
```

More details will be provided once the feature is implemented.

---

This page will be updated as soon as official scaffolding templates are released in Nextellar.
