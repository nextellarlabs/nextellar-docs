# Welcome to **Nextellar**

## Build Stellar-Powered Applications with Speed and Confidence

Welcome to **Nextellar**, a modern developer toolchain designed to help you build Stellar-powered applications with speed, consistency, and confidence. Nextellar provides a **one-step CLI**, **opinionated scaffolding**, and **first-class Stellar integration** so you can focus on product development instead of boilerplate setup.

Whether you're building a wallet, a payment experience, a dApp, or a full-scale production application, Nextellar gives you a clean, extensible foundation powered by:

* **Next.js (App Router)**
* **TypeScript**
* **Stellar wallet adapters**
* **Soroban smart-contract utilities**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **shadcn/ui**
* **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
* **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline

Nextellar reduces the time developers spend configuring tools, managing dependencies, and wiring up blockchain integrations. With a single command, you're ready to build.

## Philosophy

Nextellar is built on four core principles:

1. **Speed** — Reach real feature development in minutes.
2. **Consistency** — Every scaffolded project follows a predictable, maintainable structure.
3. **Stellar-first design** — Wallets, balances, transactions, and smart contracts are built into the foundation.
4. **Extensibility** — Customize or replace any part of the scaffold as your needs evolve.
